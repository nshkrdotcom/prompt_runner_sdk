You are running in the parent directory that contains two repos: alpha/ and beta/.

Use Bash commands (not the Write tool) to do the following:
1) In alpha/, create or update NOTES.md with exactly one line: "alpha ok".
2) In beta/, create or update NOTES.md with exactly one line: "beta ok".

Write directly into the repo paths. Do not write into /tmp or any other temp directory.
Do not modify any other files. Do not run tests. Respond with exactly: ok
